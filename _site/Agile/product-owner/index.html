  <p>I often consider the product owner to be the hardest hat to ware in Agile. You are the Achilles’ heel of Agile. A few of the things your job requires are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Getting consensus from all stakeholders: that vision</li>

<li>Giving that Vision to your Team</li>

<li>Planning and prune the backlog (Project Management) for the next iteration.</li>
</ul>

<p>You are the voice of reason. You work with everyone involved to find that minimal viable product. You work with sales people, customers, engineers, designers, marketing and so on.</p>

<p>Along with that you have to do project management. Unlike a project manager, you don’t need to actually plan how work is done. You also don’t have to be responsible for estimates. In Agile, those tasks fall onto the team. However, you do need to keep the backlog full of work.</p>

<p>This is no easy task. It requires a lot of project planning. It requires keeping your eye on where development is going and constantly validating what you are providing with what the stakeholders want.</p>

<p>A good Agile shop can deliver product weekly or even daily. This means, as a product owner, you need to be able to approve work done almost every day. A single pair can complete one or more stories that may take anywhere from 4 to 20 minutes to accept. The means a full team of 4 pairs could eat up 80 minutes a day in simply reviewing what has been delivered.</p>

<p>You might think that Agile is creating a lot of work for you. Nope. In the long run, it isn’t any more work than any other process. Agile can simply deliver more product in a shorter amount of time. As the product owner, you still need to take the time approve that work and validate it with the stakeholders and customers.</p>

<p>And once you’ve done that for the day, you will need to get ready for the next iteration planning meeting: finding that sweet spot of work for the next iteration.</p>

<p>There is a huge reward for this however. You are able to provide something to your customers weekly if not daily. And you are assured that you receive exactly what you ask for. You write the specifications and a good Agile shop using BDD (see <a href='/Agile/bdd-tool/'>Behavior Driven Development – An Invaluable Tool</a>) will deliver that exact specification.</p>

<p>Of course, if you mess up it can be devastating. Weeks or months worth of work can be lost. Which is why the Product Owner is the Achilles’ heel of Agile.</p>

<p>Are you ready?</p>
