  <p class="lead">We code hundreds of non-business specific software parts. We have low level software parts that do very simple tasks like adding two numbers.</p>
  <p class="lead">We have high level software parts that do very complex tasks like communicating across the internet.</p>
  <p class="lead">We hope you can stick with the high level parts to get your project out the door as fast as possible. However, if your business has very specific needs, you can use the low level parts.</p>

  <p class="lead">You hook up parts, using our visual object language and framework, to solve your business specific problem. That's it. There is <strong>no need</strong> to code and compile. You no longer need to debug or test because the programs you create area always running. That means immediate feedback to any changes you make. Which means much faster turn around times.</p>
