  <h2 class="featurette-heading">Vision</h2>
  <p class="lead">Interface Vision has simplified the development process by creating the first true cross platform, non domain-specific, GUI based Visual Development Platform (VDP) for the software fulfilment process: Vision.</p>
  <p class="lead">Vision enables users to collaboratively drag software parts from a toolbox, arrange the parts on a canvas, and connect the parts to direct the flow of activity through assembly: never once “using a coding environment”. This allows users to focus on their product.  Users are able to see their changes live as Vision is always running what is being built, which greatly reduces the development cycle.</p>


<p class="lead">Vision helps Entrepreneurs, Designers, Developers and Product Owners:</p>
<ul class="lead">
<li><strong>Everyone Speaks the Same Language</strong> - Entrepreneurs, UX-Designers, Developers and Product owners work seamlessly together: seeing their product emerge in real time. Getting requirements, mocking, designing and programming are all done in concert.</li>
<li><strong>Improved Reuse</strong> - Users compose software within our GUI using parts and templates which increases reuse of prior work.</li>
<li><strong>Cross Platform</strong> - Develop once and run instantly on multiple platforms including iOS, OSX, Android, Linux and Windows.</li>
<li><strong>Improved Consistency</strong> - Coding idiosyncrasies are removed leading to better interoperability: saving time, money and resources during upkeep.</li>
<li><strong>Cloud Enabled</strong> - Vision supports Saas allowing Vision programs to run seamlessly in the cloud.</li>
</ul>


<p class="lead">Vision helps Business:</p>
<ul class="lead">
<li><strong>Programs Created Are Easily Scalable</strong> - Vision solves scalability problems found in existing software architectures and programming languages.  A program configured in Vision can be easily duplicated across hundreds of servers allowing for almost unlimited scalability of your applications.</li>
<li><strong>Domain Agnostic</strong> - Using our VDP, the user can create anything from back-end B2B services to games.</li>
<li><strong>Global Regression Testing</strong> - Vision can assure backwards compatibility across all users and between different versions of our API using our cloud based regression testing service.</li>
</ul>

  <h2 class="featurette-heading">Vision Cloud Services</h2>
  <p class="lead">Vision, our Visual Development Platform, works in conjunction with our set of Vision Cloud Services. Each service is provided to further simplify the software fulfilment processing allowing the team to focus on the products they are creating. There is no longer a need to worry about versioning your products, merging versions, managing test/staging and production servers, scaling your products and backing up your products.</p>

  <p class="lead">Our cloud services include:</p>
<ul class="lead">
<li><strong>Application Execution Service</strong> - Run and scale Vision applications. Monetization is through hourly billing of computing resources.</li>
<li><strong>Application Management Service</strong> - Manage, backup, versioning, marketing (Project website) and shared editing of Applications. An integral part of Vision. Integrated into Vision’s three tier licensing.</li>
<li><strong>Application Testing Service</strong> - Test and Regression test all configurations. Monetization is a subscription basis. Integrated into Vision’s three tier licensing.</li>
</ul>

  <h2 class="featurette-heading">School Of Programming</h2>
  <p class="lead">Learning how to program is difficult. Anyone new to programming has to learn two concepts at the same time: how to analyze problems and how write source code (in at least one language.)</p>
  <p class="lead">School Of Programming takes a different approach to teaching students how to program. By taking advantage of the same technology that Interface Vision uses, we are able to teach people how to program without teaching them a programming language.</p>
  <p class="lead">A student is able to focus on analyzing and solving problems.</p>
