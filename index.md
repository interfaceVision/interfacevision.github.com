  <h2 class="featurette-heading">Step 1. <span class="muted">We Code The Parts</span></h2>
  <p class="lead">We code hundreds of non-business specific software parts.</p>
  <p class="lead">We have low level software parts that support very simple tasks like adding two numbers.</p>
  <p class="lead">We have high level software parts that support very complex tasks like communicating across the internet.</p>
  <p class="lead">We hope you can stick with the high level parts: getting your software out the door as soon as possible. However, you can use the low level parts if your business has very unique requirements.</p>

  <h2 class="featurette-heading">Step 2. <span class="muted">You Hook Up The Parts</span></h2>
  <p class="lead">You hook up parts, using our visual object language and framework, to solve your business specific problems. That's it.</p>
  <p class="lead">There is <strong>no need</strong> to code, compile, debug or test because the programs you create area always running. Always running allows you to get immediate feedback to any changes you make. This allows faster turn around times.</p>
  <p class="lead">Creating an online service? No problem. Our environment is being designed from the ground up to work seamlessly in the cloud.</p>
