  <h2 class="featurette-heading">Interface Vision</h2>
  <p class="lead">Interface Vision is a visual object language. With Interface Vision, you can develop software in any business domain without writing any source code.</p>
  <p class="lead">This means you can focus on the features of the software you are developing. You no longer need to worry about writing code, debugging code or testing code.</p>
  <p class="lead">Interface Vision allows you to create anything from OpenGL games, to web services to applications that run on portable devices. Even better, Interface Vision is cloud friendly meaning you can store and share your programs online for easy access.</p>

  <h2 class="featurette-heading">School Of Programming</h2>
  <p class="lead">Learning how to program is difficult. Anyone new to programming has to learn two concepts at the same time: how to analyze problems and how write source code (in at least one language.)</p>
  <p class="lead">School Of Programming takes a different approach to teaching students how to program. By taking advantage of the same technology that Interface Vision uses, we are able to teach people how to program without teaching them a programming language.</p>
  <p class="lead">A student is able to focus on analyzing and solving problems.</p>
